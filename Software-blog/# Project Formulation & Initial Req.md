# Project Formulation & Initial Requirements

The DnDProject is an application developed to manage employee worktimes and user access for a fictional company operating in the creative and digital domain. We chose this project domain because it addresses the common need in many small-to-medium enterprises for a simple, effective way to manage work hours, employee data, and user permissions. In addition, the project allows us to explore modern technologies such as ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core with SQLite, RESTful web services, and Blazor for the frontend. The combination of these technologies presents a robust stack for rapid development and easy maintenance.

## Why This Domain?

The motivation behind the project stems from the observation that many companies struggle with outdated or overly complex time management systems. By developing a streamlined solution, we aim to simplify employee worktime tracking and integrate user management with role-based access control. The project also offers an opportunity to learn and demonstrate best practices in both web service design and modern frontend development with Blazor.

## Requirements as User Stories

Here is a list of initial user stories that guided our requirements:

1. **As an admin, I want to log in so that I can manage employee data and worktime entries.**
2. **As an admin, I want to view a list of all employees so that I can monitor and update their information.**
3. **As an admin, I want to add new employees with details like first name, last name, email, password, and role so that I can easily onboard new staff.**
4. **As an admin, I want to edit employee details so that I can keep their records up-to-date.**
5. **As an admin, I want to delete employees so that I can remove records of staff who are no longer with the company.**
6. **As an employee, I want to view my worktime summary so that I can monitor the hours I have worked.**
7. **As an admin, I want to view detailed worktime logs for each employee so that I can verify attendance and hours worked.**
8. **As an admin, I want to generate reports on worktime so that I can make informed staffing decisions.**

These user stories served as the backbone for our development efforts. They helped prioritize features and ensured that the solution addressed the real needs of our intended users.

Throughout the development process, our focus was on creating a secure, responsive, and user-friendly application that seamlessly integrates the backend web API with the frontend Blazor application. The project has evolved based on feedback and continuous testing, and we have ensured that each user story is validated through thorough code reviews and testing phases.

In the following blog posts, we will dive into the web service design, frontend implementation, user management, data access, and finally the project conclusion and demonstration. This post sets the stage for understanding the project's domain, goals, and the requirements that drive our development process.
