# Project Conclusion & Demonstration

This final blog post summarizes the development process of the DnDProject, provides a final update on what was implemented, and reflects on the project outcomes.

## Final Development Update

Over the course of this project, we have developed a full-stack application that manages employee worktimes and user access. The backend is built as a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core with SQLite, while the frontend is a Blazor Server application. We implemented secure user management using JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization to ensure that only authorized users (such as admins) can access sensitive parts of the application.

During development, we faced several challenges:
- **Authentication and Authorization:**  
  We encountered issues with the authentication service registration, which were resolved by correctly configuring JWT Bearer authentication in the backend. This was crucial to ensuring that our endpoints secured by `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` functioned correctly.
- **Data Access:**  
  Transitioning to Entity Framework Core and LINQ streamlined our data access, reducing the need for raw SQL and simplifying the codebase.
- **Frontend Integration:**  
  The Blazor Server application was integrated seamlessly with our RESTful API, using HttpClient to perform CRUD operations. This provided a responsive and interactive user interface.

## Summary of Project Outcome

- **User Stories Implemented:**  
  - **Admin Login & User Management:**  
    Admin users can log in, view a list of all employees, and manage employee records (add, update, delete).
  - **Worktime Management:**  
    Employees can have their worktime entries tracked, and admins can generate reports on worktime data.
  - **Data Access via ORM:**  
    EF Core was used to manage data persistence with SQLite, simplifying data operations.
  - **Secure RESTful API:**  
    The backend is secured using JWT tokens, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints.
  
- **Not Implemented / Future Improvements:**  
  Some additional features (e.g., advanced reporting, file uploads, and enhanced user profiles) remain as future enhancements.

## Final Thoughts

Working on the DnDProject has been an insightful experience. We successfully integrated modern web development technologies to create a cohesive, full-stack solution. The challenges faced during authentication, data access, and frontend-backend integration have greatly enhanced our understanding of these technologies, and the final product meets the requirements defined at the start of the project.

Thank you for following our development journey, and we hope this project serves as a useful reference for building similar applications in the future.
